I am in the process of placing an order but have some questions regarding selection.1. What is best product that leaves hair shiny?2. Will the 50% be applied on all the products (total order)?3. My order is $116 before tax. Will I qualify for free shipping to Canada?Thank you in advance.TamaraOn Fri, Aug 11, 2023 at 1:48 AM <info@kcprofessionalusa.com> wrote:Hi Tamara, Thank you, I was able to find the order.
